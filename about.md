hello!Â i'm lauren, a phd student studying sociology at the university of chicago. i like to think about social and personal healing, the systems, structures, and ideologies that inspire, inhibit, and make real this healing, and the various ways we can come together across time and space to make sense of this process.

i've put together this site as a way to organize and share my own thoughts interests, and reflections. i'm always open to discussing more and am oriented towards ways to build relationships with others grappling with similar questions.
